compreheNGSive is an app for analyzing the end results of the next-generation sequencing pipeline (a better description coming soon...).

Release Notes
-------------
The program now relies on a prefs.xml file in the same directory as the app. For help on what all these parameters mean, click here.

The setup screen allows you to edit this file before running (a better GUI is coming, but the parameters are changing too fast to settle just yet!), but you are welcome to edit it externally. The old way of running command-line style is no longer supported.

Planned Features
----------------
(coming, but not here yet)

    Genome browser
    Rs # List for selected features
    Better in-parallel coordinates highlighting
    Export selections as .csv or .vcf files
    Export history (for data provenance, help in writing papers, etc)
    Refined setup screen (because the parameters are changing so fast, you're stuck with that .xml screen - sorry!)
    Expandable multi-value parallel coordinate axes
