INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
-------------------------

I would recommend using the binaries available at http://www.sci.utah.edu/~abigelow

If you're REALLY insistent on doing things the hard way, make sure the following is installed (this list is supposed to be helpful, not necessarily comprehensive - if something is missing, please let me know at alex.bigelow@utah.edu):

Python 2.7 (it's possible that an earlier version will work, but I haven't tested it)
setuptools
pyquery
PySide (>= version 1.1.1   WARNING: as of August 2012, the version that comes via Linux package managers is 1.1.0 !!! You will probably need to build this from source on Linux.)

If you're on Windows:
---------------------
You'll also need py2exe installed.

TODO

If you're on Mac OS X:
----------------------
You'll also need py2app installed.

Run the
./bundle_osx.command
command from any directory. This will create compreheNGSive.dmg in the directory from which you ran the script. Your app is inside - enjoy!

TODO

If you're on Linux:
-------------------
You'll also need cx_Freeze installed.

Run the
./bundle_linux.sh
command from any directory. This will create compreheNGSive.tar.gz in the directory from which you ran the script. Your app is inside - enjoy!
